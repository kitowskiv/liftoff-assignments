## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a community where users post intentions (prayers/goals/hopes/dreams) that are tracked and organized in a way that allows for other users to easily find and interact with those intentions. The landing page will explain the basic idea behind focused intent, placebo, prayer etc. as well as instruct users on how to do a visualization exercise/meditation to help turn the intention into reality.  Data will be collected showing how many people focus/meditate on a given intention, how long the intent has been active, and the average time users focus on the intent.  Users will be able to view statistics on a particular intention, track how long it takes for the intent to be realized, or see the success rate of an individual user.

This project was motivated by a desire to collect and analyze data pertaining to placebo effect, prayer, etc. I am also excited to create a community where people can get together and share their hopes and dreams for the future whether that is a local vison or a universal one.    


### Features
*User login: Users will be able to log in by creating accounts in the system. All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.
*Create and edit intentions: Users will be able to create new intentions in the system by entering in a mixture of required (title, date, time, etc) and optional fields (description, etc)
*Edit, Create, and Delete Categories: Users will be able to create new categories for intentions to be organized by. Categories will be flexible, and can be edited, and deleted.
*Communities: Users will be able to create groups as a means to organize intentions and create smaller communities for existing real world groups.  
*View intention statistics: Users will be able to view statistics on an intention. Users can see how long an intent has been active, track the time it has been active in relation to how long it takes to become realized, view the number of times an intent has been focused on, and view the number of users that have focused on a specific intent.
*View user statistics: Users will be able to view statistics on individual users and groups.  Users can see how successful a given user is at realizing an intention as well as see how many times the user has focused on one or all intentions.
*Delete intentions: Users will be able to delete intentions.
### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn Javascript and more bootstrap to bring the user interface up to my standards.  I will also need to learn the Google Maps API and figure out how I can use it to show a map of intentions.
